    "\"The fundamental concept in any RESTful API is the resource. A resource is an object with a type, associated data, relationships to other resources, and a set of methods that operate on it. It is similar to an object instance in an object-oriented programming language, with the important difference that only a few standard methods are defined for the resource (corresponding to the standard HTTP GET, POST, PUT and DELETE methods), while an object instance typically has many methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Resources can be grouped into collections. Each collection is homogeneous so that it contains only one type of resource, and unordered. Resources can also exist outside any collection. In this case, we refer to these resources as singleton resources. Collections are themselves resources as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Collections can exist globally, at the top level of an API, but can also be contained inside a single resource. In the latter case, we refer to these collections as sub-collections. Sub-collections are usually used to express some kind of “contained in” relationship. We go into more detail on this in Relationships.\" (https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html)"

    "## Another Aside $-$ NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "\"A NoSQL (originally referring to \"non SQL\" or \"non relational\") database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases. Such databases have existed since the late 1960s, but did not obtain the \"NoSQL\" moniker until a surge of popularity in the early twenty-first century, triggered by the needs of Web 2.0 companies. NoSQL databases are increasingly used in big data and real-time web applications. NoSQL systems are also sometimes called \"Not only SQL\" to emphasize that they may support SQL-like query languages, or sit alongside SQL database in a polyglot persistence architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivations for this approach include: simplicity of design, simpler \"horizontal\" scaling to clusters of machines (which is a problem for relational databases), and finer control over availability. The data structures used by NoSQL databases (e.g. key-value, wide column, graph, or document) are different from those used by default in relational databases, making some operations faster in NoSQL. The particular suitability of a given NoSQL database depends on the problem it must solve. Sometimes the data structures used by NoSQL databases are also viewed as \"more flexible\" than relational database tables\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two basic reasons two use a \"Not Only SQL Database:\"\n",
    "- The application does not require RDB functions, which means a reduced function DB can be cheaper, faster, more available, ...\n",

    "- There is good [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.API.html) on the API. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are several good [tutorials.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/dynamodb/index.htm)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Countless samples and examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are a lot of APIs, but there is a relatively straightforward, common core. From the manual:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Control Plane: Control plane operations let you create and manage DynamoDB tables. They also let you work with indexes, streams, and other objects that are dependent on tables.\n",
    "    - CreateTable – Creates a new table. Optionally, you can create one or more secondary indexes, and enable DynamoDB Streams for the table.\n",
    "    - DescribeTable– Returns information about a table, such as its primary key schema, throughput settings, and index information.\n",
    "    - ListTables – Returns the names of all of your tables in a list.\n",
    "    - UpdateTable – Modifies the settings of a table or its indexes, creates or removes new indexes on a table, or modifies DynamoDB Streams settings for a table.\n",
    "    - DeleteTable – Removes a table and all of its dependent objects from DynamoDB.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "- Data Plane: Data plane operations let you perform create, read, update, and delete (also called CRUD) actions on data in a table. Some of the data plane operations also let you read data from a secondary index.\n",
    "    - Creating Data\n",
    "        - PutItem – Writes a single item to a table. You must specify the primary key attributes, but you don't have to specify other attributes.\n",
    "        - BatchWriteItem – Writes up to 25 items to a table. This is more efficient than calling PutItem multiple times because your application only needs a single network round trip to write the items. You can also use BatchWriteItem for deleting multiple items from one or more tables.\n",
    "    - Reading Data\n",
    "        - GetItem – Retrieves a single item from a table. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want. You can retrieve the entire item, or just a subset of its attributes.\n",
    "        - BatchGetItem – Retrieves up to 100 items from one or more tables. This is more efficient than calling GetItem multiple times because your application only needs a single network round trip to read the items.\n",
    "        - Query – Retrieves all items that have a specific partition key. You must specify the partition key value. You can retrieve entire items, or just a subset of their attributes. Optionally, you can apply a condition to the sort key values so that you only retrieve a subset of the data that has the same partition key. You can use this operation on a table, provided that the table has both a partition key and a sort key. You can also use this operation on an index, provided that the index has both a partition key and a sort key.\n",
    "        - Scan – Retrieves all items in the specified table or index. You can retrieve entire items, or just a subset of their attributes. Optionally, you can apply a filtering condition to return only the values that you are interested in and discard the rest.\n",
    "    - Updating Data\n",
    "        - UpdateItem – Modifies one or more attributes in an item. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want to modify. You can add new attributes and modify or remove existing attributes. You can also perform conditional updates, so that the update is only successful when a user-defined condition is met. Optionally, you can implement an atomic counter, which increments or decrements a numeric attribute without interfering with other write requests.\n",
    "        - Deleting Data: DeleteItem – Deletes a single item from a table. You must specify the primary key for the item that you want to delete.\n",
    "        - BatchWriteItem – Deletes up to 25 items from one or more tables. This is more efficient than calling DeleteItem multiple times because your application only needs a single network round trip to delete the items. You can also use BatchWriteItem for adding multiple items to one or more tables.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        \n",
    "- Streams: DynamoDB Streams operations let you enable or disable a stream on a table, and allow access to the data modification records contained in a stream.\n",
    "    - ListStreams – Returns a list of all your streams, or just the stream for a specific table.\n",
    "    - DescribeStream – Returns information about a stream, such as its Amazon Resource Name (ARN) and where your application can begin reading the first few stream records.\n",
    "    - GetShardIterator – Returns a shard iterator, which is a data structure that your application uses to retrieve the records from the stream.\n",
    "    - GetRecords – Retrieves one or more stream records, using a given shard iterator.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Transactions: Transactions provide atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID) enabling you to maintain data correctness in your applications more easily.\n",
    "    - TransactWriteItems – A batch operation that allows Put, Update, and Delete operations to multiple items both within and across tables with a guaranteed all-or-nothing result.\n",
    "    - TransactGetItems – A batch operation that allows Get operations to retrieves multiple items from one or more tables.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- __Note:__ This is only \"sort of ACID.\" True ACID handles multiple tables and interleaving of reads and writes.\n",
    "    - This is more like \"atomic multiple read\" or \"atomic multiple write.\" Which is useful, and a very common scenario in databases.\n",
    "    - Also, because of the more flexible data model, the application requires fewer tables. Multiple relational tables would often map to a single DynamoDB table."
